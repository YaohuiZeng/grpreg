Description: Efficient algorithms for fitting the regularization path of
 linear or logistic regression models with grouped penalties,
 such as group lasso, group MCP, and group SCAD.  The algorithms
 are based on the idea of either locally approximated coordinate
 descent or group descent, depending on the penalty.
